Github:


GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface.


It is the world’s largest coding community, and putting a code or a project out there brings increased, widespread exposure to your code.


You can find source code in many different programming languages and keep track of all changes.

Programmers use the command-line interface, Git, to make changes.


GitHub helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration. 


GitHub is used for code sharing, and as a social networking site for programmers. 


Many companies and organizations use it to facilitate project management and collaboration.





HTTPS key:


It's simpler to access a repository from anywhere as you only need your account details (no SSH keys required) to write to the repository.


HTTPS Is a port that is open in all firewalls. 

SSH is not always open as a port for communication to external networks
A GitHub repository is therefore more universally accessible using HTTPS than SSH.








SSH key:
When working with a GitHub repository, you'll often need to identify yourself to GitHub using your username and password. 
An SSH key is an alternate way to identify yourself that doesn't require you to enter you username and password every time.


SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. 
If the keys match, you're granted access.

The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer your private key from the public one.
